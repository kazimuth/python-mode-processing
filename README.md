Processing Python Mode
======================

Processing is awesome! Jython is awesome! Together, they are TOTALLY AWESOME!

This project uses Processing 2.0's mode infrastructure to create a seamless blend of Processing and python.

Inspired by the handsome [processing.py](https://github.com/jdf/processing.py).

This is very much a work-in-progress. Don't expect it to work very well right now.
